## Rest API Notes
	- API - Aplication Programming Interface
	- Server and client
		- Client process can request from the server process
	- JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
		- standard for API
		- key value pairs, like dictionaries
	- API end points - defines what you can request
		- will cover different end points
	-  REST - Representational State Transfer
		- request type : web
	- why not App to API?
		- main concern is securitry
		- can go from web to moble easily
		- Modularity : can change tech and as long as the endpoint is the same it'll work
		- interoperability
	- OAUTH2 - security
	
	- Main commands
		- GET - retrive
		- POST - write new data
		- DELETE - delete
		- PUT - update data
			- post not garunteed, put can be ran multiple time (idempotent)
